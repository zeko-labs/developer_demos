# Portable Receipt Format

The portable receipt is the artifact that lets a third party verify mission
work without trusting the demo app or seeing private data.

Receipts use `mission-bound-auth-receipt-v1` and are intentionally redacted.
They include commitments and hashes, not raw prompts, credentials, selectors,
page text, payment secrets, private vault values, or underlying dataset rows.

## Required Verifier Questions

A verifier should be able to answer:

- Was this receipt created under a mission-bound capability?
- Does the policy hash match the approved task boundary?
- Did the holder runtime produce a trace commitment?
- Is the payment context bound to the same receipt?
- Is the receipt nullifier unique for settlement?
- Is the receipt/root anchor present for production settlement?

## Anchor Rule

A receipt can be in `anchor_prepared` while it is waiting to be finalized. A
production-settled receipt must include anchor evidence. The verifier rejects
`settlement_release_allowed` or `settled` receipts that lack an anchor unless
the caller explicitly allows pre-final receipts.
